# Nature-like typst preprint template

This is a preprint template "inspired" by the formating of the
journal Nature. More importantly than the actual look of the paper,
the template also 
handles author afilitiations (and hopefully in the future correspondence).

See below for a quick look and check the examples in
[`example/main.typ`](example/main.typ) on how to use it.

## Usage

To compile the example in this repo run:

```
make all
```
